Okay so, this is the database of **Comedy Web**, one of my projects that I have been working on since May 2020. There's many different things to check out here, and not that much. I might create a wiki for it, who knows.

# How was Comedy Web created?
Well, it was because I had a simple idea that I got from [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/). It was because I found a bunch of nice little things I could put in the web. I was originally going to try to change the database of the website into a button that would take you to a random YouTube channel, but I then found out that I couldn't really do that. So instead, I tried to just make a list of websites.

I then decided to make a list of websites inside The Useless Web, but then I realized again that I would be paying for a domain that just holds websites, so I scrapped that idea. Then, I went ahead and decided to make a list of websites, but they were all mine I created. When you clicked on a website, It would take you to a different file inside a folder, then that folder would act like a new website.

# What's the value of the domain?
The value of the domain is currently estimated at almost [USD$800](https://www.godaddy.com/domain-value-appraisal/appraisal/?isc=goodba003&checkAvail=1&tmskey=&domainToCheck=comedy-web.com), according to [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), which is what I used to purchase my domain.

# When will the project be finished?
I'm hoping sometime around the end of the year. I know, it sounds like a long time, but hear me out. For some reason, I can't connect my files to the web server, so it won't let me actually run the website. If you go to the website now, it just says **Coming Soon**. So, I have to postpone Comedy Web once I can get access to it. I mean, I do have access to the server, when I enter in the **_CORRECT_** password to the server hosting application thing, it says it can't connect.

If any of you find a solution to that problem, please let me now.
