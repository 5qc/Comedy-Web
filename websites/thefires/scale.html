    <center><h1><b><p style="font-family:arial">The Scale</p></b></h1></center>
    <center><b>The Scale</b> is an unofficial fire scale that is used to measure the intensity of fires. These fires are based off of the cost it did. So even if a fire claimed 200,000 acres of land but only $20 million of damages was done, it would still be classified as a Fire III.<br><b>(All fires are measured in USD (United States dollars)</b></center>
    <br>
        <center>I = $0 - $99k</center>
        <center>II = $100k - $999k</center>
        <center>III = $1M - $9M</center>
        <center>IV = $10M - $49M</center>
        <center>V = $50M - $99M</center>
        <center>VI = $100M - $500M</center>
        <center>VII = $1B - $2.4B</center>
        <center>VIII = $2.5B - $4B</center>
        <center>IX = $5B - $10B</center>
        <center>X = $10B+</center>
